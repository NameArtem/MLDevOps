## Model Details

- Developed by Data Scientists at GitHub with inspiration from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/team-ai/spam-text-message-classification/kernels)
- Random Forest.
- Preprocessed to clean text prior to tokenization.

## Intended Use

- Intended to be used for demonstration purposes and not commercial or otherwise.
- Not suitable for languages outside of english and should be assessed for the accuracy with different dialects/cultures.

## Factors

- Based on known problems with different text based communication methods, potential relevant factors include groups for gender, age and culture.

## Metrics

- Evaluation metrics include False Positive Rate and False Negative Rate to
measure disproportionate model performance errors across subgroups.

## Training Data

- Dataset metadata is available in the data tab.

## Ethical Considerations

- Innapropriate marking of spam or ham may be considered offensive if the model is biased towards a certain grammar.

## Caveats and Recommendations

- This is just a toy example for this demonstration purposes.
