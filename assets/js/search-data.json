This dashboard renders information in your repo relevant to machine learning projects automatically by using GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages. . Learn more Sections: . Summary: uses the /project/model_card.md file located your repo. This is meant to be a high level summary of your model. A recommended format for this is discussed in Model Cards for Model Reporting. . | Reports: these pages automatically render Jupyter notebooks located in the /notebooks directory of your repo. . | Model Timeline: this is a timeline view of relevant milestones for your ML project. This page is generated by /project/model_timeline.csv in your repo, which is system generated 1. . | Completed Pipeline Runs: This shows the most recent pipeline runs. This page is generated by /metadata/pipeline_runs.json in our repo, which is system generated 1. . | Deploy: A click-to-deploy mechanism for others to run your training pipeline and serve your model on the infrastructure of your choice. This is under construction. . | . . This system has not been designed yet. &#8617; &#8617;2 . |",

Intended to be used for demonstration purposes and not commercial or otherwise. | Not suitable for languages outside of english and should be assessed for the accuracy with different dialects/cultures. | . Factors . Based on known problems with different text based communication methods, potential relevant factors include groups for gender, age and culture. | . Metrics . Evaluation metrics include False Positive Rate and False Negative Rate to measure disproportionate model performance errors across subgroups. | . Training Data . Dataset metadata is available in the data tab. | . Ethical Considerations . Innapropriate marking of spam or ham may be considered offensive if the model is biased towards a certain grammar. | . Caveats and Recommendations . This is just a toy example for this demonstration purposes. | .",
